# Moodle Native Mobile Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Native Mobile Developer technical assignment.

The project is implemented for both platforms:

- `android/`: native Android app
android link : https://github.com/AsmaaHassenIbrahem/MoodleAndroid
- `ios/`: native iOS app
ios link : https://github.com/AsmaaHassenIbrahem/Moodle-iOS

## Assignment Scope

The app covers three main flows:

1. Courses screen
   - Fetch enrolled courses using `core_enrol_get_users_courses`
   - Show course name, progress, and image
2. Course details screen
   - Fetch course sections using `core_course_get_contents`
   - Show section titles
3. Grades screen
   - Fetch grades using `gradereport_user_get_grade_items`

## API Configuration

Base URL:

`https://moodle.itcorner.qzz.io`

REST endpoint:

`/webservice/rest/server.php`

Authentication options:

- Login endpoint: `/login/token.php`
- Demo username: `student1`
- Demo password: `Demo@12345`
- Pre-generated token is also supported

## Android

### Technologies

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- MVVM
- Koin
- Retrofit
- Moshi
- Kotlin Coroutines
- Coil
- Navigation Compose

### Structure

```text
android/
  app/src/main/java/io/qzz/moodlecandidate/
    appNavigation/
    di/
    feature/
      courses/
      courseDetails/
      grades/
    shared/
      config/
      constants/
      network/
      ui/
```

### Notes

- The Android app is organized by feature
- Each feature owns its own API interface, DTOs, repository, model, screen, and view model
- Shared concerns such as constants, UI state, and config are grouped under `shared/`
- Dependency injection is handled with Koin

### Setup

1. Open `android/` in Android Studio
2. Let Gradle sync
3. Run the `MoodleAndroid` app on an emulator or device

## iOS

### Technologies

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- MVVM
- Swinject
- Moya
- `async/await`
- `ObservableObject`
- `NavigationStack`

### Structure

```text
ios/MoodleCandidate/
  appNavigation/
  di/
  feature/
    courses/
    courseDetails/
    grades/
  shared/
    config/
    constants/
    network/
    session/
    ui/
```

### Notes

- The iOS app follows the same feature-based structure as Android
- Each feature owns its own model, repository, view model, and screen
- Shared app concerns are grouped under `shared/`
- Dependency injection is handled with Swinject
- Networking is implemented with Moya for a Retrofit-like API layer

### Setup

1. Open the `ios/` directory in Xcode
2. Select the `Moodle-iOS` scheme
3. Choose an iPhone simulator or connected device
4. Build and run

Optional:

- `ios/project.yml` is included if you want to regenerate the Xcode project with XcodeGen

## Architecture Summary

Both apps use the same high-level approach:

- MVVM
- Feature-based folder structure
- Repository layer between API and presentation
- Loading and error state handling
- Clear separation of shared concerns from feature-specific concerns

## Implementation Notes

- Progress is treated as optional because Moodle may not always return it
- Course image loading falls back when a direct image field is unavailable
- HTML-rich content is normalized before display where needed
- The apps are intentionally scoped to the assignment requirements and keep the UI clean and simple
